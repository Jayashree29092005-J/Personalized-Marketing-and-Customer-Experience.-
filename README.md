# Developer Notes

# Project Structure & Setup:

Environment Requirements:

Python 3.8+

Node.js (for front-end if needed)

MongoDB (or other DB solution)

External services like Google Analytics (for tracking) or AWS (for hosting).

# Installation:

# Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/personalized-marketing.git
cd personalized-marketing
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
npm install
Configuration Notes:

API Keys: Ensure to add your keys for external services in the .env file. Example:

plaintext
Copy
Edit
GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_API_KEY=your_api_key
MAILCHIMP_API_KEY=your_mailchimp_key
Database: Use MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing user profiles, segmentation data, and campaign results.

Sample connection config:

python
Copy
Edit
import pymongo
client = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["personalization"]
User Segmentation Algorithm:

Logic: The segmentation logic is based on both demographic data and behavioral data. Example:

python
Copy
Edit
def segment_user(user):
    if user['age'] < 25:
        return 'Young Adults'
    elif user['last_purchase_category'] == 'Sports':
        return 'Sports Enthusiasts'
    else:
        return 'General Audience'
Extending: You can add new segmentation criteria based on user interactions or external data sources.

Behavioral Tracking Integration:

Event Tracking: Use Google Analytics or a custom tracking solution to log user events. Example for tracking a product view:

javascript
Copy
Edit
trackEvent('product_view', { productId: '123', userId: 'xyz' });
